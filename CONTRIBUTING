# Contributing to the Mergington High Performance Bot Toolkit on BSC

Thank you for your interest in helping improve my fourdotmeme-bot!
Whether you want to add your web3 activities, fix a bug, or suggest
new features, this guide will help you get started. ðŸŽ‰

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository to your computer.
2. Install node.js dependencies requirements: `npm install`.
3. Run the development bot: `npm run dev`.
4. Watch log in your terminal to see the transaction status.

## Making Changes

1. Create a new branch for your changes.
   - Use descriptive names like `fastest-rpc-usage` or `fix-tx-response-time`
2. Make your changes and test them locally with wbnb-usdc pool data.
3. Push your branch and create a pull request.
4. Wait for review and address any feedback.

## Code Style

- Follow ES2022 for typescript code (backend).
- Use clear, descriptive variable names (target_address, response_time, etc.)
- Add comments to describe blocks of logic.

## Need help or have ideas?

- Check the open issues first.
  - If your problem is there, add a comment or up-vote.
  - If not there, create a new issue. Be as descriptive as possible.
- Ask in my weekend hours.
- For other general problems, email the tech me at web3ripple@gmail.com
